# Pytorch Practice

This repo is mostly a joke. I work on the simplest models because I want to understand pytorch at the simplest level possible. 

Like how can a total noob build something in pytorch? 

## Motivation

I've been seeing a lot of work on ML acceleration and I really want to understand applied ML to the highest degree possible. 

This is important!
